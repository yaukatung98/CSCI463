Thick Client

    [0] have to configure

Thin Client

    [0] Configured by a controller, can control multiple simutalously.

DBI = signal strength (Larger decibal value is better)

Antena Types

    [0] omni

        [0] Looks like a big basketball, so it sends the signal to everywhere

    [1] Dipole

        [0] single level, looks like a smashed basketball, commonm in home routers

    [2] Directionals

        [0] Shots out a really long beam, like a light house

        [1] yagi (Looks like the Antena on people's houses)

        [2] pair of bollix

    [3] Patch Graphic

        [0] shots to one Direction

Anthena placement

    [0] omni for big stadium

    [1] Outdoor for dipole
    
    [2] Patch for placing on the wall

    [3] Shoot long distances in particualr between buildings, use Directionals (have to be pointed to each other)

Band Selection

    [0] 2.4 GHz

    [1] 5 GHz

Mike

    [0] Always going to prefer a thin controller based client over a fat client especially if he has two or more wireless access points

    [1] He's going to take a lot of time not only selecitng his anthennas but also making sure that the anthenna placement supports just my users and nobody else

    [2] Going to take the time with the band selection and channel with to make sure that he has got the best possible signal he can get.



Wireless access points can be a whick client or a thin client

Thin clients are configured through a controller and make it eaiser to configure multiple units

omni, siphole, directional and patch are all anthenna types, each type has a specific signal pattern

Bandwidth, channel and channel bandwidth can affect wireless quality of service.
