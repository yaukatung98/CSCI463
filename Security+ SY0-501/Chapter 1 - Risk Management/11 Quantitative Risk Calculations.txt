Exposure Factor:

    [0] Percentage of an asset that's lost as the result of an incident

        For Example:

        [0] When the router got completely damaged, I would rate it as "1"

        [1] When the partial router rack got damaged and I just have to replace its power supplies and some cables, I would rate it as "0.75"



*Asset Value* X *Exposure Factor* = *Single Loss Expectancy*

For Example:

[0] The Asset Value of router is $5000, and the Exposure Factor is 1, The Single Loss Expectancy will be 5000



ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)

For Example:

[0] My server room probably will get flooded once 20 years, so the ARO will be 1/20 == 0.05



*SLE* X *ARO* = *Annualized Loss Expectancy*

With the ALE, we can say in real dollars based on a Percentage chance of something happenining. How much that thing is going to cost. 



MTTF: Mean time to Failure

[0] The duration of working

MTTR: Mean time to Repair

[1] The duation of raiparing time

MTBF: Mean time Bewteen Failure

[2] The combination of MTTR & MTTF, a time from a failure all the time to Repair and time until it fails again.
