Risk Management Terminology

[0] Assets: any part of our infrastructure that we are worried about getting harmed. (A router)

[1] Vulnerabilities: A weakness to an asset that leaves it open to bad tings happening to it. (Never change the default router password)

[2] Threats: A negative event (action) that exploits a vulnerability.

  [2.1] Threat Agent: The object that caused the threat. Could be a person or hurricane.

[3] Likelihood: Defines the level of certainty that something bad is going to happen.

  [3.1] Quantitative Likelihood: Data that we can refer to and look at it of a percentage change of happening in any given year.

  [3.2] Qualitative Likelihood: Hard to put numbers to against to. For example: customer loyalty. We use low-median-high to measure.

[4] Impact: The harm caused by a threat

Threats -> Vulnerability = Risk

Deal with high impact, high Likelihood threats before dealing with low impact threats first.
