Switches: (Layer 2)

    [0] Switches filter & forward data based on MAC address

    [1] Where VLANs are set up

    [2] Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents loop floods

VLAN:

    [0] Split up the single broadcast domain into multiple broadcast

    [1] Can take the 12/24 port as VLAN 1 and the rest as VLAN 2, then now we have two seperate switches

    [2] VLAN provides layer 2 seperation of networks

Flood Guarding:

    [0] Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

    [1] Commonly seen on intrusion prevention systems

        [0] Need something smart that's counting packets

    [2] SYN floods

        [0] Overload a server

    [3] Ping floods / ping scans

        [0] Overwhelm the network / identify what's out there

    [4] Port floods / port scans

        [0] identify open ports on a device

Router: (Layer 3)

    [0] Filter & forward based on IP address

    [1] Gateway router wil always be running the network address translation or NAT

Firewall:

    [0] Runs on gateway router
