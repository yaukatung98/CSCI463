Network Access Control

    [0] Wireless network

    [1] Remote Access

    [2] VPN Access

PPP(Point to point protocol)

    [0] Transport layer protocol

        [1] Initiate connection

        [2] Get address informaiton

        [3] Make connection

    [1] Password authentication Protoocl (PAP)

        [0] Password is in the clear

    [2] Challenge handshake authentication protocol (CHAP)

        [0] Server will creat a challenge to the client (Hashed password)

    [3] Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

        [0] A framework that's designed to run inside some transport layer protocol

        [1] Just handling the authentication stuff

EAP

    EAP-MD5:

        [0] Basically MSCHAP

        [1] Takes those passwords and hashes them into a MD5 hash.

    EAP-PSK (pre shared key)

        [0] Uses pre-determined symmetric keys

        [1] Similar to WPA and WPA-2

    EAP-TLS

        [0] Can handle an entire TLS

        [1] Needs server and client certificates

    EAP-TTLS

        [0] Uses the TLS exchange method

        [1] Only the server has the certificates

LEAP

    [0] Lightweight Extensble Authentication Protocol

    [1] Cisco proprietary

    [2] Uses passwords only; no detailed certificate management

    [3] Based on MS-CHAP (including MS-CHAP security shortcomings)

PEAP

    [0] protected Extensible Authentication Protocol

    [1] Created by Cisco, Microsoft and RSA security

    [2] Encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel, one certificate on the server
