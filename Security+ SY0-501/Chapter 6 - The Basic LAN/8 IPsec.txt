IPsec

    [0] A bunch of protocol that came up together to create a secure connection

    [1] Authentication headers

        [0] Provides integrity

        [2] Genarates HMAC

    [2] Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

        [0] Encrypt the data with DES, 3DES, AES first, then add the AH. 

Transport mode

    [0] Doesn't work well in real world

    [1] IP payload is encrypted

    [2] IP header is not encrypted

    [3] Original IP header is used for routing decisions

    [4] provides protection for the payload from end to end

Tunnel mode

    [0] Encrypt the data package, then add a new IP in the front

    [1] IP payload is encrypted

    [2] IP header is encrypted
    
    [3] New IP packet encapsulates the encrypted one with a new header that is used for routing decisions

    [4] Privides protection for the payload and the header from the beginning of the tunnel to the end of the tunnel (e.g site to site VPNs to connect sites.)

IPsec protocol suite

    [0] Uses negotiation protocol ISAKMP

        [0] Initial Authentication

            [0] Certificates

            [1] Preshared keys

            [2] Key exchange

IPsec with L2TP

    [0] Common

    [1] Tunnel within the Tunnel

Radius/TACACS+

    [0] Use IPsec to secute the AAA connection

IPsec with IPv6

IPsec with non-secure protocols

    [0] Using IPsec to Encrypt the telnet tunnel.

IPsec works at the IP layer

IPsec has a tunnel & transport mode

Authentication headers (AH) provide integrity
