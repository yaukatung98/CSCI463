Eletronic Code Book

    [0] Not so good, still can see the patterns 

    [1] Nobody uses this anymore

Block Modes

    [0] Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)

         [0] Initialization Vector

         [1] XOR against the Initialization Vector

         [2] Then use the output as for the next Initialization Vector, so the Initialization Vector will be different everytime it XORs

         [3] Last, encrypt the output with the key

    [1] Cipher Feedback (CFB)

        [0] Encrypt the Initialization Vector first

        [1] then XOR the data against the encrypted Initialization Vector

        [2] The output will be the next Initialization Vector for the next chunk of data

    [2] Output Feedback

        [0] Same as Cipher Feedback, except using the same Initialization Vector (Step 2)

    [3] Counter (CTR)

        [0] Nonce value + Counter (it increases as the rounds go up)

        [1] Concatenate the nonce and counter into the encryption box

        [2] Use the encrypted nonce + counter to XOR against the input data, then output the result



ECB block modes will always output the same results with the same input

A binary block is plain text converted into 16-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit binary ciphertext

CBC, CFC, OFB, CTR block modes use an Initialization Vector, which ensures the output blok is uniquely different
