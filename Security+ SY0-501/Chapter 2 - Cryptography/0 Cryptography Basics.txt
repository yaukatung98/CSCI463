Obduscation: 

    [0] To take something that looks like it makes sense and to hide it so that it does not make sense to the casual outside observer

    [1] Diffusion: Only allows us to make things less visible, less ovbious. Like to blur the picture a bit.

    [2] Confusion: To make it confuse. Like to stir up the picture.

    [3] ROT2: Rotate twice

    [4] Caesar Cipher: The shift cipher. For example, we use ROT2, A becomes C, so ABC would be CDE.

    [5] Cryptanalysis: breaking these encrypted codes.

    [6] Vigenere Cipher: An intersection encryption, Use X and Y axies key to encrypte the code.

        [0] It's great for encrypting alphabets, but not for pictures, sql databases, credit card informaiton.

    [7] Classic cryptography compoents

        [0] Algorithm

        [1] Key for encryption

    [8] Exclusive OR (XOR)

    [9] Keyckhoffs's principle

        [0] As long as you don't know waht the key is to an encryption, you can actually understand the algorithm completely.

    [10] Data at rest

        [0] Something stored on a hard drive or on optical media or on a thumb drive or whatever it might be.

    [11] Data at transit

        [0] A message or VOIP call

    [12] Data in process

        [0] The encryption/decryption within the RAM or CPU


Cryptography is the practice of disguising informaiton in a way that looks random

The caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers

The vigenere cipher employs the caesar cihper as one element of the encryption process.
