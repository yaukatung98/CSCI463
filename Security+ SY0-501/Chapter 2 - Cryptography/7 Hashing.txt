Hash

    [0] Provides integrity 

    [1] An algorithm

    [2] Comes out in a fixed value every time

    [3] Hashes are one way

    [4] Deterministic (Change one byte of the original document, the hash will be different)


Hash Types

    Collision:

        [0] Take two different types of data, and generate the same hash. If you can force a hash to make occational collisions, it can often be figured out how the hash works.

    [0] Message Digest 5 (MD5)

        [0] Invented 1992

        [1] Ron Rivest

        [2] 128 bit hash

        [3] Has Collision, not used that commonly anymore

    [1] Secute Hash algorithm (SHA)

        [0] Developed by NIS

        [1] SHA-1 (160 bit hash)

        [2] Has Collision, not used that commonly anymore

    [2] SHA-2 (256, 512)

        [0] Like SHA, but no collisions found yet  

    [3] RIPEMD (Race Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest)

        [0] Not very commonly

        [1] Open Standard

        [2] 128, 160, 256, 300 bit digest



What do we need hash:

    [0] Password storage (OS don't store plain password, it will hash whatever the users type in, and compare to the correct password's hash.)

    [1] We use hash everywhere
