Symmetric key algorithm:

    [0] Same key for encrypting and decrypting



Block:

    [0] Takes off x amount of bytes at the beginning and encryptes it and send it off to the side



Data Encryption Standard (DES)

    [0] First open standard used heavily by the US government

    [1] Short Key

    [2] Alternatives

        [0] Blowfish

        [1] TripDes

    [3] Block Cipher

    [4] 64-bit Block Size

    [5] 16 Rounds

    [6] Key Size: 56 bit



Cryptosystems:

    [0] Key Size

    [1] Number of Rounds

    [2] Block Size



AES:

    [0] Block Cipher

    [1] 128-bit Block Size

    [2] 128, 192, or 256-bit

    [3] Rounds: 10, 12 or 14



Streaming Cipher:

    [0] RC4

        [0] Streamingn Cipher

        [1] 1 bit at a time

        [2] 1 Rounds

        [3] Key size: 40 bit - 2048 bits



Triple DES (3DES) is the DES key size tripled

AES is a US government encryption standard supported by the NIST

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher
