Public key 

    [0] Encrypts

Private key

    [0] Decrypts

RSA:

    [0] Use two prime numbers (like 11, 17) to generate a semi-prime number

    [1] It usually really big

Eliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):

    [0] A lot faster than RSA

    [1] it require a lot less bit, for example it can replace a 3000 bit of RSA with 256 bit of ECC.    


Public keys are paired with a private key (ie Key Pair) when using RSA Asymmetric Cryptosystems

ECC can create a smaller key than RSA provides the same security with increased performance

Each public key has a single private key, withput the private key the information can not be decrypted
