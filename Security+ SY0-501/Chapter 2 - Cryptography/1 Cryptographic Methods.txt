Session Key:

    [0] In-band: Sending the key with encrypted data.

    [1] Out-of-Band: Hand the data directly

Symmetric encryption:

    [0] The primary way that we encrypt data.

Ephemeral Key:

    [0] Temporary

    [1] Provides perfect forward secrecy

Asymmetric encryption

    [0] Uses a key pair 

        [0] Public key

        [1] Private key

    [1] Public key only used to encrypt

    [2] Private key only used to decrypt

    [3] Slow, but very useful in exchanging session keys

Asymmetric encryption is used to send a secure session key

Cryptosystem: 

    [0] A very defined piece of cryptography that programmers can use to actually get stuff done.

    [1] Cryptosystem define key properties, communication requirements for the key exchange and the actions taken through encryption and decryption process.
