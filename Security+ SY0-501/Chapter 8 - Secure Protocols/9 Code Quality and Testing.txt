Static code analyzers

    [0] Look for standards type of error, just reading it, not running

Dynamic code analysis

    [0] runs the code looks for logic error, security holes, fuzzing

Stress test

    [0] Putting the servers underload

    [1] Sandbox

    [2] Model verification

Production

    [0] Static code analyzers review the actual code syntax and coding errors

    [1] Dynamic code analysis runs the code and looks for logic errors and security issues

    [2] In the staging phase, tests run the code through simulated scenarios, checking stress handling, throughput, and performance
