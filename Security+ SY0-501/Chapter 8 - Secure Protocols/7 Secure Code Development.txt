Agile and waterfall are example of code develpment frameworks

Agile defines a sprint with small, rapid, measurable deliverables

The DevOps cycle includes phases which are executed by development and/or operations team

Secure DevOps include automation tools, change management, and baselining, along with consideration for virtual machine setup and variations in systems.
