Compiled vs. runtime code

    [0] Compiled (C, python, compiler)

    [1] runtime code (JavaScript, browser)

Proper error handling

    [0] page 404 configured or not

Proper input validation

    [0] SQL injection

Normalization

    [0]  Indexing

        [0] turning one unnormalized Data Record into several normalized data records

Store Procedure

    [0] Check input validation before sending the query to database

Encryption/Code signing

    [0] Digitally sign the code, so whoever gets the code will know the code is in a good order

Obfuscation

    [0] Don't make it so easy for reverse engineering, so people can't copy your code.

Code Reuse/dead code

    [0] Break down as many functions as possible into individual pieces. Continue to call it over and over again. without the risk of errors

    [1] get rid of dead code, bad guy can take advantage of the dead codes.

Server-side vs. client-side execution

    [0] Client

        [0] Fill out form

        [1] Input validation

        [2] Generate query

    [1] Server

        [0] Input validation

        [1] Generates the query 

Memory management

Third-party libraries

Data exposure

Code can be executed with a .exe file on a machine, or run directly from a Web site that is coded as runtime applications

Reuse of a code module that is called from within the program to perform a repetitive action is called a stored Procedure

Third party libraries should be considered in security concerns when coding

Be aware of third party libraries used, maintain patch updates, and stay informed on their status.
