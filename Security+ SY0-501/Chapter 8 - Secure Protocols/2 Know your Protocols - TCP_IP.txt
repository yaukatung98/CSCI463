IP addressing

    [0] IPv4

        [0] Private IP addresses

            [0] NAT

                [1] 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 private IPv4 address range

                [2] 172.16.0.0.0 - 173.31.255.255 is a private IPv4 address range

                [3] 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 is a private IPv4 address range

    [1] IPv6

        [0] Link local - FE80

        [1] Internet address


Transpiort Protocols

    [0] TCP

        [0] Three-way handshake is the cornerstone of TCP

        [1] TCP - connection oriented, sends lots of packets

    [1] UDP

        [0] no acknowladgement

        [1] UDP - connectionless, sends lots of packets

    [2] ICMP

        [0] ICMP - supporting protocol, handling ARP and ping

        [1] Just one packet doing whatever it wants to do.


Recognize the difference between IPv4 and IPv6

IPv4 is a 32-bit address with 4 octets, and IPv6 is a 128-bit address

Be familiar with the transfer protocols TCP, UDP and ICMP
