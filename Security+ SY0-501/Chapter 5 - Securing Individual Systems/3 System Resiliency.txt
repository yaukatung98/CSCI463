Scalability:

    [0] Add more servers to take care the demands

Elasticity:

    [0] add the servers for a period of time

Redundancy:

    [0] Spread out the servers all around the nation

Non-presistence:

    [0] VM snap-shot

    [1] Live CD

Known state

    [0] Windows uninstall updates

Rollback

    [0] Rollback Driver

Elasticity is the ability to expand and contract your network system depending on demands

Redundancy is a form of distributive allocation

Non-presistence is data that is collected but will not be saved on restart

A snapshot reverts to known state. rolls back to known configuration, and can store non-persistant data.
