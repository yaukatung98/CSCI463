RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):

    [0] Provide intergrity

    [1] Improve access

RAID 0:

    [0] Minimun of 2 drives

    [1] Stripping

    [2] Speeds up performance, but has no data intergrity

    [3] Spread file into different clusters, and store them in different hard drive, if one hard drive died, the file would be corrupted

RAID 1:

    [0] Mirroring

    [1] Minimun of 2 drives

    [2] Slow things down

Parity:

    [0] Save one chuck of parity data into different drives

RAID 2:

    [0] same like RAID 0, but put the whole chuck of data into the third drive. so if either 1 or 2 failed, the data will still be okay.

RAID 5:

    [0] Distributed across all the drives

    [1] Was the most popular long time, cannot lost more than one drive.

RAID 6:

    [0] Minimum of 4 drives

    [1] 2 parity + RAID 0

Hybrid RAID:

    [0] RAID 10 / RAID 1+0

    [1] Minimum of 4 drives

    [2] First strip it, then mirror it

Propreitrty RAID:

    [0] A place for managing RAID

RAID arrays enable you to speed up data access, protest data, or both

The most common RAID styles includes 0, 1, 5 & 10

RAID 1 & RAID 0 requires at least 2 drives, RAID 5 requires 3 or more drives & RAID 10 requires 4 drives
