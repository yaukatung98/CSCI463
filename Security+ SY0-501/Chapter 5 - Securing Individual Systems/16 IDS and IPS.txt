First line of defense is a firewall

    [0] Prevent naughty things from the outside world ocming into our network

IDS

        [0] Inside the network

        [1] Watches within the network traffic

        [2] Sends alerts on suspicous activity

IPS

    [0] Intrusion Prevention system 

        [0] Active IDS

        [1] IPS is usually close to the edge the network

        [2] Action to prevent will occur at the IPS device

Intrusion prevention systems run inline with network and act to stop detected attacks

A firewall filters, an IDS notifies and an IPS acts to stop.
